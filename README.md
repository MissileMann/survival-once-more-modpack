<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: rgb(132, 63, 161);">Description</span></h1><p style="text-align: left;">Surviving - Once more is a survival focused modpack with a lot of different survival mechanics to deal with. This pack initially started out as a quick and dirty modpack to troll my friend by saying "This is a nice easy comfort modpack" but then throw in as many difficulty mods as I could lol. As time went on and we played I slowly refined the pack, added recipes, custom edits, fixing conflicts, to the point where I thought I might as well release it. 
  
  Terrain and some structures have been completely overhaul! Thanks to mods like [Tectonic](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tectonic), [Abnormal's mods](https://www.curseforge.com/members/teamabnormals/projects), [Geophilic](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/geophilic), [YUNG's series of mods](https://www.curseforge.com/members/yungnickyoung/projects), [Hopo Better Ruined Portals](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/hopo-better-ruined-portals), [DnT mods](https://www.curseforge.com/members/nova_wostra/projects), and many others. Tectonic terrain has been completely customized in this modpack. Smaller overall continents, smaller oceans, more islands, biome placement changes, etc. The pack includes some small introductory quests to some mods and progression information thanks to the mod [Questlog](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/questlog). There are a lot of decorational blocks to choose from. Enjoy a cozy home in these dangerous times! The vanilla visuals have been improved with mods like [Coastal Waves](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/coastal-waves), [Wakes](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/wakes-reforged), [Pretty Rain](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/pretty-rain), [Better Clouds](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/better-clouds), and more!

This modpack was initially inspired by one of [Forgelab](https://www.youtube.com/@ForgeLabs)'s videos, [Surviving the Harshest Winter](https://youtu.be/rmgaht6D1S0?si=FHWh3hBObQXT3D3e)

A lot of changes in the modpack were inspired by the modpack [Raspberry Flavoured](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/raspberry-flavoured). (It is suuuuuuuch a good modpack, please play it. I highly recommend it)
